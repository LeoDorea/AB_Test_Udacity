# A/B_Test_Udacity

Project made as part of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.

The project follows a given report as a guide to evaluate results from an A/B test run by an e-commerce story.

The goal is to understand if they should implement a new page, keep the old one or, perhaps, run the experiment longer to get into a conclusion.
